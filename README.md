# Gov-1006-Replication-3

This is Jack Schroeder's replication of "The Political Legacy of American Slavery" by Avidit Acharya, Matthew Blackwell, and Maya Sen (2016). It was done for Gov 1006: Models in collaboration with Enxhi Buxheli.

The paper can be found [here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/msen/files/slavery.pdf). The data was taken from [the Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CAEEG7).

There is an rmd file (Week-1.Rmd) and a pdf file (Week-1.pdf) that summarize the first week's worth of work.

There is also a folder titled Dataverse_Files that contains all files from the paper uploaded to the Harvard Dataverse.

Finally, there is a readme, which you are now finished reading.
